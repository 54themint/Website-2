                            Whether it be Inter-Dynasty Minecraft, Year 6 Technology presentations, Scavenger Hunts, or Tetris competitions, we've always been enthusiastic about giving students opportunities to explore technology outside of the classroom. With our recent rebranding and recruitment, we are proud to have expanded our activities and initiatives, with an online presence (go follow us on Instagram @wis_digital_leaders) as well as future events such as Inter-Dynasty Dress to Impress.

                            In today's digital age, where technology plays a major role in education and everyday life, we recognise the importance of empowering students with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive. As Digital Leaders, we are a passionate group dedicated to fostering a vibrant tech culture within the West Island School community. Our aim is to create positive impacts by providing students with engaging opportunities to explore and harness the power of technology beyond the classroom walls.

                            So far, we have achieved this through various initiatives such as hosting inter-dynasty events that make technology engaging and fun, such as Inter-Dynasty Dress to Impress and ID Minecraft. Additionally, we traditionally conduct annual visits to the Kennedy School on the role of technology in education. In the past, we conducted a presentation to the ESF School Council highlighting the potential integration of technology in learning environments. A very recent addition to these efforts includes creating Instagram posts and reels to educate the student body on technology as a general topic, ensuring a broader reach and fostering a deeper understanding of its impact and potential.
